# Neocortex web project

## What is Neocortex?

Neocortex is a fictional website for my school web dev project.
Made completely in pure JS with no framework.
I've used Lenis, GSAP and text-split for various text animations that can be found in [scripts.js](https://github.com/mateyy11/neocortex-web/blob/master/scripts.js)

## To do:

The site is defo not done yet - i still have to make all links clickable and make the entire site responsive

#Let's bring Neocortex to life!

##Fire it up!

Ready to blast off? Head over to the [html] folder and launch [index.html] in your browser. And the best part? No need for a server - this baby can fly solo! (Just note that some jQ scripts had to be disabled for a serverless approach, cuz we had to lol)

##What's Neocortex all about?

Neocortex is a super cool website project for my school web dev class. And get this - it's built entirely with pure JS, no frameworks allowed! I've used Lenis, GSAP, and text-split for all the amazing text animations you'll find in [js] folder.

##To-do List:

- Make it look great on any screen size
- Tweak the design to perfection

Stay tuned!

This site is still a work in progress. But don't worry, I've got this!

##LATEST UPDATE:

- Streamlined the animations for a smoother experience
  -It's getting closer to being finished! Just a few more things to go
  -Bug? What bug? I squashed a few.

# Neocortex web project

## What is Neocortex?

Neocortex is a fictional website for my school web dev project.
Made completely in pure JS with no framework.
I've used Lenis, GSAP and text-split for various text animations that can be found in [scripts.js](https://github.com/mateyy11/neocortex-web/blob/master/scripts.js) and script tags at the end of each .html file

## To do:

- Files cleanup
- Idk lmao

## Updates

The site is deffinitely not done yet. There's a lot of work to do.
LAST UPDATE:

- Major size updates
- Navbar animation on scroll
